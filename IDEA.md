# Speak: Web app for foreign language intonation training
## Goal
Help people to improve their level of speaking foreign languages by focusing on intonation, melody and flow.

## Features
- Make conversation with the user in a language of their choosing
- Provide interesting topics to talk about
- Let the user repeat words and sentences, recording them and playing them back to compare with the "native" version
- Maintain a history of all conversations (what was said? what was repeated and played back? ...)

## Requirements
- Follow the general guidelines described in WEBAPP_GUIDELINES.md
- Use the OpenAI APIs for text-to-speech and direct audio processing
- Use the colors and forms of @speak/icon.svg for the app design

## Open questions
- What is the best workflow for such an app?
- What is an intuitive way of choosing topics or sample sentences to read out and repeat?
- How can improvements or success be measured?
